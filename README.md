## Introduction
Our project aims to optimize the association link and power selection in the Space-Air-Ground Integrated Network (SAGIN) system using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Q-Learning.

## Goal
To enhance the performance and reliability of the system.

## System Architecture
The space-air-ground integrated network LEO (Low Earth Orbit) satellites, HAPs (High Altitude Platforms), Ground Users
